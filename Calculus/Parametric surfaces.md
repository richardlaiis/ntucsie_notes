# Parametric methods

1. $(x, y, f(x,y))$
2. $(r\cos{\theta},r\sin{\theta},z(r,\theta))$
3. $(r\sin{\phi}\cos{\theta},r\sin{\phi}\sin{\theta},r\cos{\phi})$
4. surface of revolution: $(g(z)\cos{\theta},g(z)\sin{\theta},z)$, when we use it, we should think that we are going to use integrals to process the **rotation** of something

## Example

taking surface of revolution as example:

Consider the region between $x^2+y^2+z^2=4$ and above $z=a\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$.

The region can be expressed as $(\sqrt{4-z^2}\cos\theta,\sqrt{4-z^2}\sin\theta,z)$.
